# Horiseon-Optimization
Optimization for the Horiseon Webpage

## Description

This project is a optimization of the Horiseon Social Solution Services webpage. My motivation was to make the webpage more accessible for all groups of people. This page allows most people, including screenreaders, to be able to navigate the webpage and take full advantage of the services that this company provides. I have learned that double checking webpages for attributes to help accessiblitiy is something all coders should do.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The best way to use this is to locate the links in the [horiseon header](images/screenshot.png) and use them to jump to the section of the page you need to go to.

Once you locate the section you need you can then read up on the needed information and use the [side bar](images/screenshot1.png) to access more info.
